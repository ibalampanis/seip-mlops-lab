# Software Engineering in Practice | Machine Learning & MLOps Lab

## Corpus Description

The slides present an overview of a lecture focused on the fundamentals of Machine Learning (ML) and Machine Learning Operations (MLOps). The main objective is to give participants a solid understanding of ML basics and the processes involved in bringing ML models into production through MLOps. The lecture is structured into several key sections:

1. **Introduction to Machine Learning:** This section emphasizes the importance of ML in driving efficiency, automation, and innovation across various industries such as healthcare, finance, and entertainment. It defines ML as a subset of AI that allows systems to learn and improve from experience autonomously.

2. **Basic Machine Learning Workflow:** It outlines the fundamental steps in creating an ML model, including data collection, preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, and iterative refinement for accuracy enhancement.

3. **Types of Machine Learning:** The lecture categorizes ML into three types: Supervised Learning, where the model learns from labeled data; Unsupervised Learning, which finds patterns in unlabeled data; and Reinforcement Learning, focused on making decisions based on feedback to achieve goals. Each type is explained with process details and real-world applications.

4. **Introduction to MLOps:** This section introduces MLOps as the integration of ML, DevOps, and Data Engineering, aiming to streamline the ML model lifecycle. It highlights the importance of MLOps in ensuring the reliable deployment and maintenance of ML models in production environments, detailing the key components, best practices, and tools involved in the process.

5. **Practical Demonstration:** This part involves a hands-on example or case study illustrating the application of Machine Learning in a real-world scenario, sentiment analysis of movie review. [This is the repository](https://github.com/garosap/imdb-sentiment-analysis) respresenting the demo.
